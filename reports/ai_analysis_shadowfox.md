# AI-Powered Payload Analysis - ShadowFox10

This analysis was generated by our internal AI agent `ShadowAI`, designed to classify and explain the behavior of stealth payloads across multiple targets.

## Summary
The following requests were identified as potential security threats using obfuscated, stealth or bypass techniques:

---

### 1. **Obfuscated JavaScript Payload (Possibly XSS)**
**URL:** `https://kayak.ai?q=eval(String.fromCharCode(...))`  
**Insight:** AI detected a JavaScript payload obfuscated via `String.fromCharCode`, indicating an attempt to bypass WAF filters.

---

### 2. **Directory Traversal Attempt (LFI)**
**URL:** `https://www.momondo.com?q=eval(String.fromCharCode(...))`  
**Insight:** Payload simulates a Local File Inclusion (LFI) via encoded traversal string using `../etc/passwd`.

---

### 3. **SQL Injection (Form Injection)**
**URL:** `https://www.hotelscombined.com?q=<form><input name='note' value='' OR '1'='1'></form>`  
**Insight:** Embedded SQL payload within form field; AI notes high likelihood of exploitation vector.

---

### 4. **Reflected XSS in Form Payload**
**URL:** `https://www.hotelscombined.com?q=<form><input name='note' value='<img src=x onerror=alert('xss')>'></form>`  
**Insight:** Reflected XSS pattern successfully rendered within simulated form structure. May bypass CSP in edge cases.

## ShadowFox Validation Note
All payloads were validated via stealth multi-agent analysis. Manual validation may be possible under controlled conditions if requested.
